            <h2>Volunteer Recognition</h2>
            <p>
      	  The National Youth Council is recognizing notable youth volunteers and clubs. After taking nominations as of May 10th, we are proud to announce <b>Evergreen Valley High School</b> has been chosen to represent Silicon Valley in Red Cross clubs all over the nation.

      <h2>Youth Awards Night Awards</h2>
      <p>As the end of the year is coming up fast, we wanted to give you a sneak peek of some new and returning awards that will be handed out at our 2018 Youth Awards Night!</p>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Most Active Volunteer</b>: This award is given to the Silicon Valley Red Cross youth volunteer who has recorded the highest number of individual hours on Volunteer Connection for the 2017-2018 school year.</li>
      <li><b>Lifetime Achievement Award</b>: This award is given to the Silicon Valley Red Cross youth volunteer who has recorded the highest number of individual hours on Volunteer Connection over the entire course of their volunteer service.</li>
      <li><b>Presidential Award of Service</b>: This award is given to the Silicon Valley Red Cross youth volunteers who have completed at least 150 hours of service (documented on Volunteer Connection) within the last calendar year (January 1, 2017 - January 1, 2018).</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Put yourself in the running for these awards (and next year's Presidential Award) by entering in all of your Red Cross service hours into your Volunteer Connection account today! Any <b>Red Cross-related activities</b> count - blood drives, club meetings, fundraisers, etc - so make sure to record it all.</p>
      <p>Your hours will also support your Red Cross club's candidacy for the <b>Club of the Year Award</b>, so encourage your fellow club members to enter their hours in, too.</p>
