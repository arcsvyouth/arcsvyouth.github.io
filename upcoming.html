        <h2>Raid Cross is on 1/13 (Saturday) 1-4PM</h2>
        <p>
          Raid Cross is a role-playing simulation activity devised by the French and Belgian Red Cross societies to help young people aged 14-21 explore:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <b>humanitarian issues</b> involved in <b>armed conflict</b> situations.</li>
            <li>The basic rules of <b>International Humanitarian Law (IHL)</b> that apply in those situations.</li>
            <li>The importance of these rules in conflict situations, including <b>preventing civilian casualties</b> and excessive damage to civilian objects, e.g., schools, homes, cities and towns.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          This event is an excellent opportunity for youth to participate in Red Cross and learn more about international involvement, and we encourage everyone to participate if they can! Email svrc.internationals@gmail.com with any questions!
