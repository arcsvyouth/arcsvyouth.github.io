      <h2>Spotlight</h2>
      <p>This month's spotlight is on <b>National Youth Involvement Month</b>! NYIM is an American Red Cross initiative that aims to heighten participation and leadership of Red Cross youth volunteers. It is a month dedicated to encouraging and celebrating youth involvement, especially by shining a spotlight on outstanding youth activities. This year’s NYIM theme is <b>Race of the Regions</b>. We hope to engage Red Cross youth in a national competition to see which Red Cross region is the most involved throughout the month of November!</p>

    <h2>Profile Pictures</h2>
    <p>To celebrate National Youth Involvement Month, we created a Facebook Profile filter for you to share and help promote volunteerism. The Facebook filter is available <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profilepicframes/?selected_overlay_id=113250252937913">here</a>. Just click to apply the filter to your profile and use the hashtag <b>#NorCalRaceOfTheRegions</b> when you post to your wall! As an extra incentive, we will be randomly drawing two winners to receive free Red Cross merchandise. To enter, simply apply the filter to your profile and show proof of participation in one NOVEMBER Red Cross event. This can be a club meeting, chapter wide event, or more; just remember to submit your hours on Volunteer Connections. All youth Red Cross volunteers are eligible to enter the drawing. </p>
