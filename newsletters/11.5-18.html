      <h2>Spotlight</h2>
      <p>This month's spotlight is on <b>National Youth Involvement Month</b>! NYIM is an American Red Cross initiative that aims to heighten participation and leadership of Red Cross youth volunteers. It is a month dedicated to encouraging and celebrating youth involvement, especially by shining a spotlight on outstanding youth activities. This year’s NYIM theme is <b>Race of the Regions</b>. We hope to engage Red Cross youth in a national competition to see which Red Cross region is the most involved throughout the month of November!</p>
      <p>Our chapter project is <b>Totes of Hope</b>. Learn more below!</p>
